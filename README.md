# DentAI_Segmentation_YOLO_Sam2
Deep learning model for dental image segmentation using YOLOv8 and Sam2, applied to standard mouth images for precise tooth detection and labeling.

This project uses the YOLOv8 and Sam2 object detection model to segment teeth from standard mouth images. It is part of a broader effort to apply computer vision to dental diagnostics using deep learning.

## 🧠 Objective

To detect and segment individual teeth from intraoral or frontal mouth images (not X-rays) using YOLOv8 and Sam2, in order to assist with automated dental analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Sam 2
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📁 Dataset

A custom dataset of labeled dental images was used. Each image has corresponding annotations in YOLO format.

## 📓 Notebook

The full training and evaluation pipeline is included in the Colab notebook:  
`DentAI_Segmentation_YOLOv8.ipynb`

## 📊 Example Output

*Sample outputs are added inside the `outputs/` folder (if available).*
